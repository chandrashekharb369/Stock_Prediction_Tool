Stock Prediction and Analysis Tool 📈💰OverviewThis project is a Python-based tool that predicts stock prices using a combination of historical stock data, news sentiment analysis, and linear regression. It also stores predictions and actual prices in a SQLite database.FeaturesStock Data Fetching: Fetches historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.News Sentiment Analysis: Scrapes news articles from Google News and analyzes their sentiment using VADER.Price Prediction: Predicts future stock prices using linear regression.Database Storage: Stores predictions, actual prices, and sentiment data in a SQLite database.Real-time Price Tracking: Fetches and displays the real-time stock price.Past Prediction Retrieval: Retrieves past predictions from the database.Tech StackPythonPandasNumPyyfinancescikit-learnVADER SentimentGoogleNewsNewspaper3kSQLiteRequirements ⚙️Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:Python 3.6 or higherpip (Python package manager)Python DependenciesInstall the required Python packages using pip:pip install pandas numpy yfinance scikit-learn vaderSentiment GoogleNews3 newspaper3k nltk
Setup and InstallationClone the Repository:git clone <repository_url>
cd stock-prediction-tool
Install Dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Application:python main.py
How to Use 🚀Run the main.py script.Enter the NSE stock symbol when prompted (e.g., TCS, RELIANCE).The script will fetch historical data, analyze news sentiment, predict the future price, and display the results.The predictions and actual prices are stored in the stock_predictions.db SQLite database.Project Structurestock-prediction-tool/

Code Explanation 🧑‍💻Import Libraries: Imports necessary libraries for data manipulation, web scraping, sentiment analysis, machine learning, and database interaction.Database Setup:init_db(): Creates the stock_data table in the stock_predictions.db SQLite database if it doesn't exist.save_prediction(): Saves the stock name, prediction date, predicted price, sentiment, real price and real price time into the database.get_past_predictions_df(): Retrieves past predictions for a given stock from the database and returns them as a Pandas DataFrame.Data Fetching:fetch_stock_data(): Fetches historical stock data from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance library.fetch_news(): Fetches news articles related to the stock from Google News using the GoogleNews library.Sentiment Analysis:analyze_sentiment(): Analyzes the sentiment of the fetched news articles using the VADER sentiment analysis tool.  It calculates a compound sentiment score for each article.Prediction:The script merges stock data and sentiment data.It trains a linear regression model using the historical data and sentiment scores to predict future stock prices.The model predicts the closing price for the next day.Real-time Price:Fetches the real-time price of the stock using yfinance.Main Function:Initializes the database.Prompts the user for a stock symbol.Fetches stock data and news articles.Analyzes sentiment.Trains the linear regression model.Makes a price prediction.Saves the prediction to the database.Displays the predicted price and real-time price.Future ImprovementsImplement more sophisticated machine learning models (e.g., LSTM, ARIMA). 🧠Incorporate more data sources (e.g., social media sentiment, financial reports). 📰Develop a web interface for easier interaction. 🌐Add error handling and logging. 🛠️Improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis. 📈Add functionality to visualize past predictions and actual prices. 📊Disclaimer ⚠️This tool provides stock price predictions for informational purposes only.It is not financial advice, and you should not rely on it to make investment decisions.Stock prices are highly volatile, and past performance is not indicative of future results.The developers are not responsible for any financial losses incurred as a result of using this tool.ContributionsContributions are welcome!
